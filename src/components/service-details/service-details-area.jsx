                    services and to help collect data. The text in a cookie
                    often consists of a string of numbers and letters that
                    uniquely identifies your computer, but it can contain other
                    information as well.

                    In addition to standard cookies, we can use other similar
                    technologies to store and read data files on your computer.
                    This is typically done to improve speed and performance by
                    storing certain files locally. Similar to standard cookies,
                    these technologies can also be used to store a unique
                    identifier for your computer, which can then be used to
                    track behavior. These technologies include Local Shared
                    Objects (or “Flash cookies”).

                    Lysa Consultancy retains personal data for as long as
                    necessary to provide the services and the feedback you have
                    requested, or for other essential purposes, such as
                    complying with our legal obligations, and enforcing our
                    agreements. Because these needs can vary for different data
                    types, actual retention periods may vary. The criteria used
                    to determine the retention periods include:
